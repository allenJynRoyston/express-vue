# Express/Vue Boilerplate  (with built in support for SemanticUI/ThreeJS/Framework7)

### What Am I?
Build a website or webapp quickly with the fantastic Vue.js and Express with Gulp automating several key tasks.  Lots of care was taken to ensure that your app will have SSR (server-side rendering) AND SPA (single page app) support.  In addition, this repo includes EventEmitter.js (https://github.com/Olical/EventEmitter) that's designed to supplement Vue.js inability to let components communicate with one another easily.  Other packages included (but can be removed easily in the supplied Gulp file):    
  - jQuery
  - Three.js (for fun visuals)
  - SemanticUI (for desktop)
  - Framework7 (for mobile)
  
 Despite the additional files, the complete gzip minized file is less than 400kb and loads very quickly.  

### Installation
$ git clone:https://github.com/allenRoyston/express-vue.git
$ cd express-vue
$ npm install
$ gulp

At this point, Gulp will start a server at http://localhost:3030.  Any file changes will also update your browser automatically via BrowserSync.
